OXYGEN
rate umol/m2/h
instrument accuracy mg/l
vol chamber volume m3
```{r}
hourfun_o2 <- function(rate, acc, vol)
{mg = rate*32*0.018/1000000/vol #convert rate umol/m2/h to mg/l/h based on user-provided chamber volume and aerial flux rate
(acc*3)/mg #divide accuracy (mg/l) by expected change (mg/l/h) to get time (h)
}
```

Ruppia NPP rates are 10-200 mmol/m2/h = 6000-15000 umol/m2/h
```{r}
rates = seq(500, 5000, 500)
accs = c(0.16, 0.4)
vols_l = c(5, 10, 15, 20)
vols_m3 = vols_l * 0.001

do_times <- hourfun_o2(rates, 0.16, 0.015)
plot(rates, do_times)
```

DIC
accuracy is 4 umol/kg = 4 mmol/m3
1 m3 water = 1000 kg
```{r}
hourfun_dic <- function(rate, acc, vol)
{chng = rate*0.018/vol
acc/chng
}

hourfun_dic(0.41, 4, vols)
```
